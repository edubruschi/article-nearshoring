                            <p>In a global economy scenario in parallel to US dollar rate increasingly valued against emerging markets, having the opportunity of access to talented software developers, especially at a competitive costs, seems to be an attractive option for every size companies in th USA.</p>
                            <p>This option turns even more appealing when you consider regions/countries where the time difference is less than 2-3 hours: that's what is called nearshore development.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>American companies currently have a deficit of good software engineers * and this situation can often lead businesses being unable to grow at expected rate – this is a serious constraint to many businesses in fact. In general, nearshoring provides companies a chance to compensate the shortage of technical expertise, offering others motivated and well instructed teams the opportunity to produce top notch software applications.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>Also, bringing in external expertise can often help contribute to the overall market, not only within the company but also your region and country. That's because nearshoring isn’t taking away jobs – it actually provides opportunities for companies to continue to grow and bring more people in to cover other needed and equally important roles, like sales, marketing, BI analysts etc.</p>

                                <p>The recommended tips for beginners companies on nearshoring are:</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Do not focus only on reduced costs, look for talented skills abroad</strong></p>
                                <p>Not to fall into the trap of going into a nearshoring partnership only reduce costs. Companies must pay attention on getting the right talent people/company. As a general rule this will result in two benefits: lower costs and improved productivity.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Give due importance to the development management process</strong></p>
                                <p>It's crucial to ask the partner to take you through the processes for delivering software. They must be able to explain why each step is important for your business and how it will contribute to realizing benefits. Avoid partnering with companies that only supply people and leave all the process management and people management to the demanding company.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Work under simple management strategies</strong></p>
                                <p>Simple communication strategies have a very important role in this process. It's important to set simple strategies for the critical management areas so everyone knows what is expected and can do their jobs during the development period.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Find a company that interests you in your success as well</strong></p>
                                <p>It is important to work with a partner who can help the daily basis work. Having a trusted partner that can give personal on-site leadership will certainly help you in making sure your software dedicated development team is following relevant processes.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Bring both teams closer</strong></p>
                                <p>Plan to visit your prospective nearshore partner whenever possible. Live a day or two in the life of your nearshoring partners, see their day-to-day routines. Talk to the developers, testers and quality assurance people to find out how they work. At the end of the day, this ends up bringing healthy informality, which may make the subsequent relationship between both teams much easier.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Defines senior touchpoints from both sides</strong></p>
                                <p>The product owner role, one of the most important on software/product development, should be filled by a person who ideally has the responsibility for using the tool being built or someone who has the authority to represent these interests. Ensure that you have someone in place that is engaged in the project and is responsible for ensuring the finished product is exactly what you need. The same concern is valid for nearshore side.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Count on your partner to define exactly which positions will be filled abroad</strong></p>
                                <p>As part of the partnership, your nearshoring company should be able to advise you on the different roles that need to be filled. You can then decide which of these roles you will fill with in-house staff and which are to be filled by your nearshoring provider.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

In addition, <a href="https://datausa.io/profile/cip/110701/">colleges and universities are graduating just shy of 30,000 new computer science majors per year</a>.
